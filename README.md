## Core Concepts

### Sockets
**Sockets** are the fundamental building blocks for network communication. They act as endpoints for data exchange between two programs. In Java, you'll use the `java.net.Socket` and `java.net.ServerSocket` classes.

### Client-Server Architecture
The chat app will follow a **client-server model**:
* The **server** listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
* **Clients** connect to the server to send and receive messages.

### Threads
To handle multiple clients concurrently, you'll use **threads**. Each client connection will typically be managed by a separate thread.

## Basic Implementation

### Server-Side

1.  **Create a `ServerSocket`**: This listens for incoming client connections on a specific port.
2.  **Accept Connections**: Use the `accept()` method to accept incoming client connections. This method returns a `Socket` object representing the connection with the client.
3.  **Create a Thread for Each Client**: For each accepted connection, create a new thread to handle communication with that client.
4.  **Handle Client Communication**: Inside the thread:
    * Get the input and output streams from the `Socket`.
    * Read messages from the client using the input stream.
    * Send messages to the client using the output stream.
    * Implement logic for broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

### Client-Side

1.  **Create a `Socket`**: Connect to the server using the server's IP address and port number.
2.  **Get Input and Output Streams**: Obtain the input and output streams from the `Socket`.
3.  **Send Messages**: Read user input from the terminal and send it to the server using the output stream.
4.  **Receive Messages**: Read messages from the server using the input stream and display them on the terminal.
5.  **Create a Thread for Receiving Messages**: Use a separate thread to continuously listen for incoming messages from the server.

## To Run

1.  Save the code as `Server.java` and `Client.java`.
2.  **Compile**: `javac Server.java` and `javac Client.java`
3.  **Run Server**: `java Server`
4.  **Run Client(s) in separate terminals**: `java Client`

## Key Considerations

* **Error Handling**: The example provides basic error handling. Enhance it for production use.
* **Concurrency**: Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (like `synchronized` blocks) to manage shared resources and avoid race conditions.
* **User Interface**: This is a basic terminal-based app. For a more user-friendly interface, consider using GUI libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
* **Security**: For real-world applications, consider security measures like encryption.
* **Scalability**: For larger systems, explore techniques like connection pooling and asynchronous I/O.
